=head1 NAME

Sub::Call::Recur - Self recursive tail call invocation.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    sub fact {
        my ( $n, $accum ) = @_;

        $accum ||= 1;

        if ( $n == 0 ) {
            return $accum;
        } else {
            recur( $n - 1, $n * $accum );
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements Clojure's C<recur> special form.

C<recur> is a tail call to the current function. It is a bit like assigning the
arguments to C<@_> and invoking a C<goto> to the first expression of the
subroutine.

It can be thought of as the C<redo> operator, but for subroutines instead of
loops.

This form allows functional style looping with constant stack space.
